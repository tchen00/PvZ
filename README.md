### DAY 4: May 19 2019
- **Tammy**
    Realized she made bad decisions by studying for the APCS/APUSH exam instead of doing the project so she will make up all the work this week!
    Started to make the plant abstract class and the methods that are inside each plant -- Made the constructor and set the fields for the Plant class and added the methods according to the prototype!
