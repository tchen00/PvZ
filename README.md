- **Tammy**
    Was burnt out after APCS (over studied for the test -- should have listened to Mr. K) : made the test folder

### DAY 3: May 18 2019
- **Peihua**   
    Finished constructors for Zombie classes. Loaded the images in for zombies and added display methods for the zombies.

### DAY 4: May 19 2019
- **Tammy**
    Realized she made bad decisions by studying for the APCS/APUSH exam instead of doing the project so she will make up all the work this week!
    Started to make the plant abstract class and the methods that are inside each plant -- Made the constructor and set the fields for the Plant class and added the methods according to the prototype!

### DAY 5: May 20 2019
- **Tammy**
    Started on the final project grind. Continued to work on the Plant classes (specifically the Sunflower and Peashooter classes). Got the display to work for plants. Experimented in the test/experiment folder about different ways to implement timers and mouse-clicks (mousePressed). Also added in plant PNG to the folder
